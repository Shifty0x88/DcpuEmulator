DCPU-16 emulator written in Java with a Swing front-end.

This is a very early version which does display the DCPU screen
I'm not entirely sure it's correct, since i've only got Notch's
sample program to go from.

To use.

You will need gradle installed to run the build.

Running "gradle run" will start the emulator.  There are only two menu options at the moment:

File>Load - will load a hex dump (see the test directory for examples)
File>Run - will run the emulation. A trace of the CPU running is written to sysout.

TODO:
 * Move the trace to a CPU status pane in the application
 * Add a step/breakpoint while running.
 * Assembler to produce a listing file
 * Add keyboard support
 * Add floppy disk support (when there are some more details)
 * Get the cpu cycle time to match the real processor.
 * Write a FORTH interpreter
