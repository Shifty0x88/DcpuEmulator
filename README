DCPU-16 emulator written in Java with a Swing front-end.

This is a very early version which does display the DCPU screen
I'm not entirely sure it's correct, since i've only got Notch's
sample program to go from.

To use.

File>Load - will load a hex dump (see the test directory for examples)
File>Run - will run the emulation. A trace of the CPU running is written to sysout.
File>Assemble - will assemble a file and put the resulting .hex file in the same directory as the asm file

TODO:
 * Add keyboard support that works
 * Add floppy disk support (when there are some more details)
 * Better error handling and reporting
 * More Intuitive GUI
